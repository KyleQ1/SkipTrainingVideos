# SkipTrainingVideos
Skips most of cal poly's [mandatory training videos](https://calpolystudents-ca.safecolleges.com/training/assignments). Screen *needs* to be fullscreened to work. Should automatically click NEXT buttons when they show up and move on to the next video when the current video is done. Shows alert when screens needs user interaction and when screen is paused. Currently only works for windows but can work with other oses with [extra dependencies](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#linux).

## Dependencies 
Need to install python and pyautogui. Python can be installed directly from the website and pip can be ran in terminal after downloading python using the `pip install pyautogui`.

## Running this project
After cloning the repo this can be ran in vscode by downloading the python extension and calling run in the top right corner. This can also be directly ran through the terminal by going to the directory and running `python __init__.py`.

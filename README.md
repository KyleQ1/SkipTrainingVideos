# SkipTrainingVideos
Skips most of cal poly's mandatory training [videos](https://calpolystudents-ca.safecolleges.com/training/assignments). Shows alert when screens needs user interaction and when screen is paused. Screen needs to be fullscreened to work. Currently only works for windows but can work with other oses with [extra dependencies](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#linux).

## Dependencies 
Need to install python and pyautogui. Python can be installed directly from the website and pip can be ran in terminal after downloading python using the `pip install pyautogui`.

## Running this project
After cloning the repo this can be ran in vscode by downloading the python extension and calling run in the top right corner. This can also be directly ran through the terminal by going to the directory and running `python __init__.py`.
